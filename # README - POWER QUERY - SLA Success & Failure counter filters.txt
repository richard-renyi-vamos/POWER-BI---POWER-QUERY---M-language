To create a measure in Power BI that filters for "SLA outcome" equal to "SLA success," you can use the CALCULATE function. Here's how you can write the measure:

DAX
Copy code
SLA Success Count = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('YourTableName'),
    'YourTableName'[SLA outcome] = "SLA success"
)
In this measure:

Replace 'YourTableName' with the actual name of the table in your data model.
This measure counts the rows where the "SLA outcome" column is equal to "SLA success."
If you want to perform other calculations (e.g., sum, average), you can replace COUNTROWS with the appropriate DAX function.

For example, if you want to sum a specific column where "SLA outcome" equals "SLA success," you can use:

DAX
Copy code
SLA Success Total = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM('YourTableName'[YourColumnName]),
    'YourTableName'[SLA outcome] = "SLA success"
)
Replace 'YourColumnName' with the column you want to sum.

This approach ensures that the calculation only considers rows where the SLA outcome is "SLA success." ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“Š
