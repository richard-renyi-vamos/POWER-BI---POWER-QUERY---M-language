ChatGPT
Creating a Power BI query to add a new custom column with the specified condition involves using Power Query (M language). Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

Open Power BI Desktop.
Load your data into Power BI.
Open Power Query Editor by clicking on Transform Data.
In the Power Query Editor:

Add a Custom Column:
Click on Add Column tab.
Click on Custom Column.
Enter the Custom Column Formula:
In the Custom Column dialog box, provide a name for your new column, e.g., NewColumn.
Enter the following formula in the formula box:
m
Copy code
if [ColumnA] = "WHITE" then "CUBE" else [ColumnB]
Here’s what the steps look like in Power BI's Power Query Editor:

m
Copy code
let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\YourFilePath\YourFile.xlsx"), null, true),
    Sheet1 = Source{[Item="Sheet1",Kind="Sheet"]}[Data],
    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Sheet1, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
    #"Added Custom" = Table.AddColumn(#"Promoted Headers", "NewColumn", each if [ColumnA] = "WHITE" then "CUBE" else [ColumnB])
in
    #"Added Custom"
Detailed Explanation:
Load Source Data: The data is loaded from an Excel file. Adjust the file path as needed.
Promote Headers: The first row is used as headers.
Add Custom Column: A new column NewColumn is added with the condition: if ColumnA is "WHITE", then the new column will have the value "CUBE". Otherwise, it will take the value from ColumnB.
Once you have entered the formula, click OK.

Apply Changes:
Click on Close & Apply to load the transformed data back into Power BI.
Now, your data should have a new column that meets the specified condition.
