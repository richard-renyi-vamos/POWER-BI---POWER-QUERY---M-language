Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to creating a Power BI query that calculates the average salary for team members from a data table:

Connect to Data Source: First, connect Power BI to your data source. This could be an Excel file, SQL database, or any other supported source.

Load Data: Load the data table containing information about team members and their salaries into Power BI.

Transform Data (if necessary): If your data needs cleaning or transformation, you can use Power Query Editor to do so. Ensure that the columns containing salary information and team member IDs are correctly formatted.

Group by Team Member: In Power Query Editor, select the column containing team member IDs. Then, go to the "Transform" tab and click on "Group By". Choose to group by the team member ID column and select "Average" as the aggregation method for the salary column.

Rename Columns (optional): You might want to rename the columns in the resulting table to make them more understandable. For example, you could rename the columns to "Team Member ID" and "Average Salary".

Close and Apply: Once you're satisfied with the transformations, close the Power Query Editor and apply the changes to your dataset.

Visualize the Data (optional): You can now create visualizations in Power BI based on the calculated average salaries. For example, you could create a bar chart showing the average salary for each team member.

Here's a basic M query that calculates the average salary for team members:

M
Copy code
let
    Source = YourDataSource,
    // Assuming the table is named "TeamMembers" and contains columns "TeamMemberID" and "Salary"
    Grouped = Table.Group(Source, {"TeamMemberID"}, {{"AverageSalary", each List.Average([Salary]), type number}})
in
    Grouped
Replace YourDataSource with the actual name of your data source, and adjust column names accordingly if they differ from the example.

This query groups the data by the team member ID column and calculates the average salary for each team member.
