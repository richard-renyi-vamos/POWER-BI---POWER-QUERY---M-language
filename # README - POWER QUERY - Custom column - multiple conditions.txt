create a POWER BI QUERY that replace every cell in a NEW CUSTOM COLUMN
► IF COLUMN A = WHITE , then COLUMN B = CUBE
► IF COLUMN A = BLACK, then COLUMN B = PYRAMID
► ELSE-IF COLUMN B = BALL

ChatGPT
Sure! Here's a Power BI Query that achieves the desired transformation using Power Query M language. This query will create a new custom column based on the conditions provided.

Open Power BI Desktop.
Load your data into Power BI.
Go to the "Transform Data" section to open Power Query Editor.
Add a new custom column using the following steps:
Steps in Power BI:
Open Power Query Editor: Click on "Transform Data" to open the Power Query Editor.
Add a Custom Column:
Click on "Add Column" from the ribbon.
Select "Custom Column".
Power Query M Code:
In the "Custom Column" dialog, you can enter the following formula:

m
Copy code
if [ColumnA] = "WHITE" then "CUBE"
else if [ColumnA] = "BLACK" then "PYRAMID"
else "BALL"
Complete Example
Here is a more detailed example of what the entire query might look like if you're scripting it directly:

m
Copy code
let
    // Load your data source here, this is just an example
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\path\to\your\file.xlsx"), null, true),
    Sheet1 = Source{[Name="Sheet1"]}[Data],

    // Promote headers if necessary
    PromotedHeaders = Table.PromoteHeaders(Sheet1, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),

    // Add Custom Column
    AddedCustom = Table.AddColumn(PromotedHeaders, "NewColumn", each 
        if [ColumnA] = "WHITE" then "CUBE"
        else if [ColumnA] = "BLACK" then "PYRAMID"
        else "BALL")
in
    AddedCustom
Explanation:
Source: This step loads your data from an Excel file. Adjust the file path as needed.
PromotedHeaders: This step promotes the first row of the table to headers if they are not already headers.
AddedCustom: This step adds a new column named "NewColumn" with the logic provided:
If ColumnA is "WHITE", the value in NewColumn is "CUBE".
If ColumnA is "BLACK", the value in NewColumn is "PYRAMID".
For all other values in ColumnA, the value in NewColumn is "BALL".
After adding the custom column, you can close and apply the changes to load the modified data back into Power BI. 🌟📊😊✨🚀📈💡🔧👍📋
