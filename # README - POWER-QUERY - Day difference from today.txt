create a custom column in POWER BI - POWER QUERY, M LANGUAGE: date difference from today's date in days 
ChatGPT
To create a custom column in Power BI using Power Query (M language) to calculate the date difference from today's date in days, you can follow these steps:

Open Power Query Editor: In Power BI Desktop, go to the "Home" tab and click on "Transform Data" to open the Power Query Editor.

Add a Custom Column: In the Power Query Editor, go to the "Add Column" tab and click on "Custom Column".

Enter the Custom Column Formula: In the "Custom Column" dialog box, you can use the M language to create a formula that calculates the date difference. The M language formula to calculate the date difference from today's date in days is:

m
Copy code
= Duration.Days(DateTime.LocalNow() - [YourDateColumn])
Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

DateTime.LocalNow(): This function gets the current date and time.
[YourDateColumn]: This represents the column in your dataset containing the dates you want to compare.
- (Minus): Subtracts the date in [YourDateColumn] from the current date and time.
Duration.Days: Converts the resulting duration into the number of days.
Replace [YourDateColumn]: Replace [YourDateColumn] with the actual name of your date column. For example, if your date column is named "OrderDate", the formula would be:
m
Copy code
= Duration.Days(DateTime.LocalNow() - [OrderDate])
Complete the Custom Column: Give your new custom column a name, such as "DaysFromToday", and click "OK".
Here's how it looks visually in Power Query Editor:

Click "Transform Data" to open Power Query Editor. 😊
Go to "Add Column" and click "Custom Column". 🎨
In the "Custom Column" dialog, enter the formula and replace [YourDateColumn] with your actual column name. 📅
Name your custom column "DaysFromToday". 📝
Click "OK" to create the column. ✅
Your dataset will now include a new column that shows the number of days between each date in your specified column and today's date! 🎉📊🌟
